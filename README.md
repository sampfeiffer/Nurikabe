## What is Nurikabe
Nurikabe is a Japanese logic puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a grid of square cells with some cells containing a number clue. The goal of the game is to identify each non-clue cell as a wall or a garden.

Each Nurikabe puzzle has a unique solution that meets the criteria below. Note that in Nurikabe, two cells are considered connected if they are horizontally or vertically adjacent; diagonal adjacency does not matter.

1. Each clue cell is a part of a garden whose size equals the clue number.
2. Each garden must contain exactly one clue.
3. All walls must be connected.
4. There cannot be a 2x2 section of walls.

For convenience, cells can be marked with a dot to represent that they are part of a garden.
